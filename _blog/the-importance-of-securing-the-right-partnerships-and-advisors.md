The blockchain industry is one that [generally](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-cash-hard-fork-battle-who-is-winning-the-hash-war) prioritizes collaboration and community over competition. It’s about working together to create innovative projects to evolve the space and further the overall reach of crypto. The serious players in the sector have a shared goal of achieving mainstream adoption and making crypto the ecosystem of the future — so it makes sense to merge strength, knowledge, and connections.

We’ve previously touched upon [the importance of networks](https://tldr.global/blog/leveraging-contacts). Raising a strong community is equally as important as raising capital in this modern space. But, it can be difficult to find the right partners that align with your core mission, values, and working methods. So, where do you begin?

## Identifying Your Needs

The first step is to know your strengths and where you need help. We don’t mean to sound like a motivational poster, but understanding the key mission and goals of your business is imperative if you want to find a suitable collaborator. Not having a clear vision of your end goal could lead to unsuitable collaborations that fail to add value to either project. TLDR’s Managing Partner, Tom Graham, shares his views on why collaboration is so vital:

> “You find a lot of people who believe that their technology will be the thing that drives adoption or users to their project. That's naïveté and a lack of understanding of how businesses work and grow. If you're a first-time founder, or if you haven't scaled or built a big company in the past, it's not reasonable to think that you can do it alone. So find help, there are certainly a lot of people who will want to help you.”

By understanding the value and aims of your project, you can begin to assess your individual strengths and weaknesses, and then search for a partnership or advisory project that can patch those weaker areas.

## Where to Begin

The blockchain industry is an exciting space to inhabit. It’s evolving and many within the industry are working hard to create solutions that will help the market mature and drive mainstream adoption. From [ICO funding hitting a high and surpassing 2017’s funding in the first quarter of 2018](https://www.coindesk.com/6-3-billion-2018-ico-funding-already-outpaced-2017/), to ongoing developments in regulatory discussions across the globe, this momentum within the token economy has led to the emergence of an absolute wealth of blockchain events happening worldwide. And they’re the perfect place to make valuable connections for collaborations or community building.

At TLDR we’re advocates of the right networking events — we not only make it our goal to actively attend and speak at the best blockchain events, but [we also support and sponsor events](https://medium.com/@TLDR_Global/tldr-looking-ahead-to-beyond-blocks-bangkok-f7b80dbcc3c9) that can provide a platform for networking, such as Beyond Blocks Bangkok. [TLDR’s own advisory partnership with South Korean supply chain project, TEMCO](https://medium.com/@TLDR_Global/tldr-signs-first-south-korean-based-project-temco-2d225564c8cf?source=user_profile---------5------------------), began at Korea Blockchain Week after people from both projects started a conversation about collaboration. Tom discusses his views on finding the right collaborator:

> “Find people who have done this kind of thing before—employees, partners, or advisors, who have built big, interesting companies and have dealt with their problems. I think the largest problem faced by startup projects is that they don't know what they don't know. They have no frame of reference and that makes it really difficult. So I think that TLDR looks for emotional maturity on the side of the entrepreneur, to understand that it takes a village to build a company.”

[Collaboration and community are vital to any successful project in the crypto space](https://medium.com/@TLDR_Global/the-importance-of-community-and-engagement-80d8cbbef6d8) and networking events are a hub for knowledgeable, experienced, and interested people, projects, and advisors that could be potential collaborators.

## The Role of the Advisor

The rapid growth of the crypto industry is creating a vibrant and active marketplace for innovators and investors. However, this success has a potential downside for new startups. It can be difficult to gain the traction and awareness you need for your project. The simple fact is, without the right community, it’s difficult to get noticed within a busy marketplace. Tom shares his views on why a good product isn’t enough:

> “In crypto we have thousands of these companies, all at the same stage, all running against each other, all facing the same problems. A lot of them will fail and just peter out into nothing. Some of them will find the right partners, the right combination of entrepreneurial talent to make it to the next step in the evolution. These are the companies who'll have the users. It’s something that projects need to be really conscious of, and aware of their own limitations. Your technology might be fantastic, but technology on its own does not solve the sales problem, or the marketing problem, or the consumer problem.”

An advisory partnership provides new startups with a link to knowledge, skills, experience, and an established network. They can provide the extra weight needed to rise above the cramped market space. TLDR Partner, Andrew Durgee, believes that advisors are imperative to the success of a project:

> “Some of the best projects that I've seen have failed because they didn't understand how to properly deliver to market. That's what advisors really do. If you had to boil down advisory solutions to one specific thing, it’s delivery to market. You can have the best technical solution in existence, but if you don't know how to deliver it to market then it will just die on the vine and disappear into obscurity, or someone will clone it into a different varietal and figure out how to deliver it appropriately. There are a lot of pitfalls and issues that take place as you're developing the project that if you haven't done it before, or haven't done it multiple times, you just wouldn't see coming. An advisory firm, such as TLDR, will be extremely familiar with the processes. We are extremely networked with the right people. We know how to deliver to market, and we can near ensure the success of a project.”

## Perfect Partnerships

When looking for a potential partner or collaborator, you need to consider the mission and values of your project. A good collaboration should smooth the process, eliminating weaknesses and providing combined strength to break into the market. If you don’t choose your partner carefully, you could run into friction that could slow you down, or sink your project entirely.

Finding an advisory service or collaborators that align with your company culture and goals is the key to forming a successful and powerful partnership. Andrew shares TLDR’s perspective on partnerships:

> “TLDR is incredibly selective. This is why we have such a strong reputation and why TLDR's advisors are a large investor signal. We heavily vet our projects, because if the project's not successful then it's a significant loss for us. From a project’s perspective, to court an advisory group like TLDR, the project would need to have some traction already. Whether that's from a technology standpoint or a community standpoint. I like to see projects that have a really clear roadmap of how they're going to be successful. The roadmap doesn't have to be accurate but I like to see that someone's put work in to identify and set their own goals. We can come in and help to re-evaluate that, but it gives me an understanding of how realistic they are with the project.”

Knowing your goals and finding an advisor or advisory group that can visualize those goals and help you in working towards your mission is vital. It needs to be a symbiotic relationship that leads to success for both parties.
