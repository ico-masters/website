The days of the hard sell and aggressive advertising are long gone. Consumers are no longer passive and naïve. They are savvy, experienced and conscious that if they don’t find value with one product or service, they know exactly how and where to find a replacement with relative ease. The global and digital landscape has opened up the playing field and forced advertisers and marketers to reconsider their approach and think of ways of adding value to the consumer across every step in the customer journey. Traditional “Mad Men” often harbor a negative opinion and perception of content marketing. But, like it or not, it is a proven strategy that, when expertly employed, generates significant ROI.

## What Are The Benefits Of Content Marketing?

The benefits of a content marketing strategy have been written and eulogized about extensively. But in essence they boil down to the following:

* Effective content brings more traffic to your site.
* Content marketing drives conversions.
* Useful content that engages consumers helps build brand awareness.
* Content can be used to educate your customers, build trust and foster stronger customer relationships, improving your brand’s reputation.
* Valuable content will help you build credibility and authority by positioning your business as an industry expert.
* Blogs and other types of content will continue to generate traffic long after they’ve been published — content is shareable.
* Content helps to improve search engine optimization (SEO) and online visibility, whilst also driving more social traffic.

## How Does Content Marketing Apply To The Crypto Space?

Content marketing transcends all industries. Regardless of the space your business or project inhabits, there is always a need for content. Whether this be to inform and educate existing or potential consumers or investors about your project, or to develop credibility and authority, crypto projects need to have a content marketing strategy in place.

Eugene Kan heads up TLDR’s branding and marketing strategy, and he summarises the reasons why crypto projects need a content marketing strategy quite succinctly:

> _"Building in a human layer of trust is still critical amidst running a project within the crypto space. A point-of-view, a dedication to quality content creation, and signaling transparency are important to build understanding and trust."_

Within a space whose volatility is well-documented, and one where the average person on the street struggles to understand the nature and machinations of the crypto universe, building that trust and understanding is critical.

For those in the know, sometimes the solution provided by a project or the tech behind it is enough to excite and maintain interest. Still, TLDR Partner Graham Friedman explains why having great tech and an innovative project will only get you so far:

> _"A project with strong tech can actually lean on that alone for quite a while. However, tech alone can prevent you from reaching the desired masses. It is important to create a marketing campaign that is consistent from public sale, well into Year One of development. A consistent tone is not only helpful in proving your legitimacy but will also incentivize HODLing during the slow periods where news of updates becomes less frequent. It’s, therefore, necessary to devise a thought out marketing approach in order to bolster your tokens on the secondary market."_

This then begs the question, “Is content more important in the public phase, or should it be a priority during a private sale too?”

Ultimately, consistency is key. Remember, consumers are savvy and they’ll see through unconvincing or erratic trends in your approach to content. Graham is of the opinion that slow and steady wins the race:

> _"Content should be viewed as a living entity during the course of the sale. To release a content blitz solely during the public sale is a mistake in that you are preventing your brand from maturing. A slow drip of data is key to get the seeds of your project’s awareness budding."_

The cryptosphere is a curious place, and its inhabitants want to learn. Projects at the start of their journey should lay foundations upon which they can build a framework of content around their project — a statement of action that investors can use as a point of reference. Even if tech is all that you have, it is important to show it off. Being able to present and offer investors a broad understanding of who you are and how much you’ve grown is vital in this space.

## The Medium Of Choice

Medium has very quickly established itself as the platform of choice for crypto projects when it comes to pushing long-form content and announcements.

As an online publishing platform made up of a hybrid collection of amateur writers and professionals, Medium provides a full WYSIWYG user interface when editing online and offering various options for formatting. In short, Medium makes it easy to blog, so you don’t have maintain your own website. And it’s this minimum effort requirement, along with its simple user interface and comfortable user experience, that has made it a popular choice for projects looking to proliferate content, according to Eugene:

> _"I would say that in general, companies have elected to use Medium due to its ease, general UX/UI, and the sort of tech community its fostered (and subsequently bled into crypto)."_

That almost ready-made audience that Medium provides is also a good reason to use it as a crypto publishing platform. Unlike traditional blogs, Medium tailors suggested content to each reader’s preferences based on newsfeed highlights and engagement with other content. This allows readers to see interesting, relevant, provoking articles without having to sift through pieces they aren’t interested in.

> _"Ultimately, the two main factors for choosing Medium as a publishing tool lie in the existing (baked in) network and community, and the convenience of use. Owned websites are better but require more friction to overcome whether it’s branding, design, development, etc."_

The fact that Medium is generally text-first, makes it a suitable place for crypto content marketing since crypto articles are generally info-heavy. With visual taking a backseat, typefaces and pull quotes become an important part of the mix, and Medium facilitates this.

## What Other Content Creation Platforms Are Crypto Projects Embracing?

According to Eugene, crypto projects seem to focus their content creation on just a handful of platforms (aside from Medium):

> _"In the English-speaking world, the big ones are definitely Twitter, Reddit, and once Steem (which seems to be losing momentum). The power of these platforms lies in community. Social media is only as powerful as the consolidation of similar interests. Crypto Twitter ceases to exist if there aren’t a network of people focused on the same things."_

[Community engagement can really make or break a crypto project](https://medium.com/@TLDR_Capital/why-icos-and-tges-are-ground-breaking-fundraising-models-33e8ba718836) so it’s essential for projects to concentrate their content marketing efforts in the social spheres inhabited by their prospective investors. Twitter inherently makes it easy to follow relevant parties, activate push notifications, and get real-time commentary. Alternatively, Reddit provides a way to engage in deeper dialogue and ask pointed questions with multiple vantage points. In this respect, Reddit is by far the most consolidated example of educational material for the crypto community.

## What Does Does The Future Of Content In Crypto Look Like?

As with all new tech, it’s very much a case of trial and error from one phase to the next, as new methodologies and expectations are established, and either improved or done away with altogether. Content marketing in crypto is no exception, as Eugene explains:

> _"It’s my belief that in the beginning, the actual execution of content didn’t need to be very high. Crypto projects don’t always possess a team of strong marketers. But as we see new projects continuing to come out, and requiring better messaging, better production, and different tactics to cut through the noise, marketing requirements change."_

Looking ahead, Eugene’s insight on the future of content in crypto is quite philosophical:

> _"We’ve yet to see the professionalism of media companies and outlets from regular, more mainstream verticals come over into the crypto space. What’s the Bloomberg, Economist, NY Times, New Yorker of crypto? Maybe it doesn’t need its own verticals or approach to storytelling yet, but a defined journalistic level and quality has existed for some time. The expertise of both the space and journalists will rise accordingly with the maturity of the space."_
