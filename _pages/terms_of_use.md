The website [www.tldr.capital](https://www.tldr.capital), including the content, images, materials and information available on or through it (the "**Website**"), is governed by these Terms of Use (the "**Terms**"). By continuing to use this Website, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to these Terms.

**Ownership.** The Website is owned, maintained and operated by TLDR Universe Limited. Despite the use of terminology that may convey the idea that the services advertised in the Website are provided by a single entity, “TLDR Capital”, there is no such single entity providing all of the services. The services advertised in the Website are provided by separate legal entities, in accordance with the laws and regulations applicable to each of the services.

**Disclaimer.** THE WEBSITE IS PROVIDED "AS IS," MAY NOT BE RELIED UPON FOR ANY PURPOSE OR REASON, AND IS NOT SUBJECT TO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. We make no representations or warranties with regard to the Website’s accuracy, completeness, non-infringement or fitness for a particular purpose. You should be aware that a significant portion of the Website includes or consists of information that has been provided by third parties and has not been validated or verified by us. Without limitation on the effect of other warnings and disclaimers set forth in these Terms, you should interpret any statements we make (on this Website or otherwise) as bounded and modified in light of the confidentiality agreements we are subject to.

**Limitation of Liability.** NO TLDR CAPITAL INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY BASED UPON YOUR USE OF, OR RELIANCE UPON, THIS WEBSITE. Some jurisdictions limit our ability to disclaim liability. With regard to those jurisdictions, our liability shall be limited to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law. For the avoidance of doubt, we are not responsible for any decision you make, or action you take, based on your visit to the Website or the information obtained therein.

We accept no responsibility whatsoever for viruses, malware or other malicious or damaging software contained in the Website or otherwise. Please ensure that your own computer security is comprehensive and up to date before you access the Website.

This website may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you.

Except as expressly stated by a TLDR Capital entity in writing, the Website makes no effort to present a comprehensive or balanced description of TLDR Capital or its activities.

**Intellectual Property.** We reserve all rights with respect to the design and content of this Website. In particular, you must not misappropriate the design or content of this Website and you must not alter or deface such design or content in any way. Nothing on this Website grants any license with respect to such design or content.

By sending us information about your business model, your plans, your ideas or any confidential or proprietary information, you accept that we are not under any obligation of confidentiality and we do not accept any responsibility for protecting against misuse or disclosure of any confidential or proprietary information or other materials in the absence of our express written undertaking to do so. We may use or disclose, for any purpose, reason or in any manner we determine, in our sole discretion, anything that you send to us without signing with us a prior written confidentiality agreement. Please consider this carefully before sending us any information or other materials that you deem confidential or proprietary.
