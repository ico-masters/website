We all know we need to take care on the internet. We’ve heard the horror stories of phishing scams, leaked personal data and hacked bank accounts. Here are some tips to help protect yourself from ID theft.

In our previous article, [Physical Security in the Crypto Space](https://medium.com/@TLDR_Capital/physical-security-in-the-crypto-space-bee91aca6e7f), TLDR COO and former Navy SEAL, Chuck McGraw, discussed building up good security routines and habits so that they become second nature. There is, however, a flipside to this — the small bad habits we’ve picked up online, such as password reuse and skipping multi-step authentication for a quicker login experience, could be putting us at risk.

One of the most potentially damaging threats that could arise from complacent cybersecurity is identity theft. In a nutshell, ID theft is when fraudsters access enough personal information, such as your name, date of birth, current or previous addresses, to commit identity fraud. Fraudsters can use this data to:

* Open bank, credit card or loan accounts in your name.
* Order goods using your personal information.
* Take over your existing accounts.
* Take out mobile phone contracts.
* Obtain genuine documents such as passports and driving licenses in your name.

Identity fraud can have a huge impact on your personal finances and could tarnish your credit rating, making it difficult for you to obtain financial credit in the future.

One of TLDR’s key focuses is improving general awareness and knowledge of cybersecurity and keeping you and your personal data safe and secure. Former FBI Supervisory Special Agent and key member of the [TLDR Security Division](https://medium.com/@TLDR_Capital/meet-the-tldr-security-team-4e0cc4964380), Jason Truppi, delves into some of the most common bad security habits that can put you at risk, and how to avoid being a soft target.

## Breaking Bad Habits

The internet is evolving rapidly to keep up with the demands and needs of users. However, occasionally these changes can leave us more vulnerable if we don’t take proper precautions.

One of the biggest emerging trends recently is the IT industry’s migration to cloud assets in order to process and store data. The benefits of cloud storage are massive: efficiency, space-saving and low-cost storage of important data. We no longer have to rely on external HDD drives or USB sticks to store our data.

Although the switch from cold storage to hot may seem safer, it’s not to be taken for granted. While it’s impossible to physically lose something, as you can with a thumb drive, anything stored online is vulnerable to hacking if not protected properly. Jason explains the risk:

> _“Several high profile breaches in the last year came from misconfiguration of cloud environments that exposed sensitive data to the Internet that could be accessed and viewed by anyone. In some cases, the data was exposed by misconfiguration of the cloud environment. In others, the data was exposed unintentionally through permission-based (access) features built into cloud storage applications made for easy file sharing.”_

Bearing this in mind, it’s always important to research any cloud storage company you want to store or process data with, to ensure they have a good reputation. It helps to remember the 3 R’s of the internet age: rating, ranking and recommending.

Perhaps surprisingly, one of the other major methods of data exposure actually happens offline. [A huge 66.5% of adults own a smartphone](https://www.recode.net/2017/10/16/16482168/two-thirds-of-adults-worldwide-will-own-smartphones-next-year). Think about the private data that you keep on there — personal photographs, passwords, signed-in social media accounts, contacts — the list is endless. Now imagine what a bad actor could do with that information if they got their hands on it. Jason explains how to keep your data safe in the event of theft or loss:

> _“One common type of data exposure comes from lost or stolen devices that contain sensitive personally identifiable information (PII). If you are a custodian of data you must make a conscious effort to encrypt all of your devices (especially mobile devices, phones, laptops, tablets, etc). Encryption will reduce the risk of exposing data when a device is lost or stolen.”_

Loss or theft of a cell phone isn’t the only place we’re vulnerable. Phone hijacking (also referred to as SIM swapping or porting) is on the rise and leaves your personal data as just as much of a risk as a theft. Jason has shared some insight into protecting yourself and what to do if your phone is ported here:

* [What Happens When Someone Hijacks Your Phone?](https://medium.com/@TLDR_Capital/what-happens-when-someone-hijacks-your-phone-d75bb9e2af3)

As the old saying goes: an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

## Day-to-Day Danger

It’s easy to take our online safety for granted when most modern devices come with pre-installed threat detection — but we shouldn’t get complacent. Jason explains that often it’s the common day-to-day habits that we’ve picked up that will increase our risk:

> _“Operating daily on the Internet exposes many people to vulnerabilities that they are unaware of, but in many cases invite the most risk to an individual or organization. Two distinct areas that are risky, but not normally perceived as dangerous, are file sharing and authentication.”_

He breaks this down further:

> _“Sharing files is quite common for business and personal use, through email, chat applications and hyperlinks. Downloading and executing files from these various locations is regularly exploited by hackers and fraudsters to gain unauthorized access to victim devices. Phishing leads the industry as the top intrusion vector year after year because regardless of your security posture, attackers prey on the weakest link in the chain — humans.”_

It’s human nature to trust. We want to trust people. So, when we receive messages or files via a public chat service such as Slack, Telegram or WhatsApp our natural instinct is to trust the source and open the message or file. But hackers rely on this nature, as it’s more predictable and easier to break down that the multiple layers of security provided by software.

In our previous article on Social Engineering, Jason expanded on this inherent human weakness, saying: _‘In many ways, social engineering is easier than finding a technical vulnerability in software or hardware, so hackers will continue to exploit the weakest link.’_

The other major weak point is once again human; human error, not software errors. We’re creatures of habit so we often use weak or recycled passwords to ensure quick access. Jason explains why this is dangerous:

_“Weak passwords and password reuse are frequently exploited by hackers to gain access to your personal and corporate accounts._[_In his 2018 research, Troy Hunt, from the website haveibeenpwned.com commented that 86% of passwords in breaches had been used or seen in the data he collected over several previous high profile breaches_](https://www.troyhunt.com/86-of-passwords-are-terrible-and-other-statistics/)_. This means that most passwords are weak or reused, and are easily guessable. The passwords can be brute forced by attackers by using known password lists from previous breaches.”_

Veteran Cyber FBI Special Agent and TLDR Security Team leader, Andre McGregor, discussed weak passwords in a prior post:

_“Quite frankly, many passwords under 13 characters are easily hackable. The longer the password — even by just one extra character — the better the entropy and the harder to hack. Better yet, using a password manager allows for it to generate a long, complex password that you don’t have to remember.”_

He also explored some other methods you can use for protection, including multi-step authentication and using a virtual private network (VPN) here:

* [The Evolution Of Cyber Security In The Crypto Space](https://medium.com/@TLDR_Capital/the-evolution-of-cyber-security-in-the-crypto-space-cf08be360f88)

Jason further explains the use of the multi-step authentication:

_“Most online services allow for users to implement two-factor or multi-factor authentication (2FA/MFA) on their accounts. Organizations know that weak and reused passwords are rampant so 2FA and MFA have been implemented to add a layer of security to the online application. Most users do not enable 2FA or MFA on their accounts and are exposing themselves to a certain level of risk that can be mitigated.”_

### Expect the Unexpected

Hackers will always follow the ebb and flow of the internet — often reacting to new developments with their own innovative methods of attack. Jason covers one of the lesser seen, but equally risky threats:

_“Another not so obvious risk exposure comes from how users post and communicate on social media. Social media gives attackers troves of information about their victims. Places they travel, who their friends and family are, potential passwords they may use and a variety of other metadata. Setting strict security policies within each social media account can be cumbersome since each application is quite different, but it could reduce your risk of exposing too much information to unwanted parties.”_

The only way to protect yourself in this situation is to take constant care with your online interactions and keep security in the forefront of your mind — always enable the highest level of security for your online actions possible.

### The TLDR Recap

1. Bad habits that we’ve picked up online could be putting us at risk.
2. One of the most potentially damaging threats that could arise is identity theft, where fraudsters access enough personal information to commit identity fraud.
3. While it’s impossible to physically lose something stored on the cloud, it’s more vulnerable to hacking than cold storage.
4. One of the other major methods of data exposure actually happens offline — phone loss or theft. Be sure to password protect and encrypt your data.
5. The human factor is the weak link in cybersecurity, so be vigilant.
6. Never reuse a password and utilize multi-step security wherever possible.
7. Be wary of what data you share online, particularly on social media as this can be used for ID theft.
