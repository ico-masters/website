Securing digital assets is the number one concern for participants engaging in the crypto economy - from blockchain projects and crypto companies, to institutions looking to engage with the technology. But the truth is, security extends further than just the safety of crypto assets in the digital space.

Our team of security experts works with individuals and organizations to establish and develop good physical security practices, in addition to the necessary cyber security protocols required to safeguard their assets. Security is already at the forefront of all TLDR's efforts, and with the continued growth and development of the blockchain space and increase in crypto activity, TLDR has seen the need to expand its security division's offering.

## Meet the Director of Security

The appointment of Jon Fisher as TLDR's Director of Security should come as no surprise. Having, until recently, served as a Cyber Supervisory Special Agent in the FBI's Cyber Division and liaison to the National Security Agency, Jon's extensive experience at the highest level of security management makes him an invaluable addition to the TLDR team. Upon his appointment, Jon underlined his desire to help TLDR make its mark within the blockchain space:

> "I was eager to join the team. Not only do they possess an unmatched level of expertise in cybersecurity, but they are also standing at the forefront of the blockchain industry. The team's impressive range of experience ensures TLDR will set standards. I am incredibly excited to contribute to the effort of bolstering security for organizations and being a part of the growth of the blockchain industry as a whole."

Jon's efforts leading international FBI operations, utilizing advanced detection and mitigation techniques, mean that he'll be in good company within TLDR's security division. Jon will join Andre McGregor and Jason Truppi - both former FBI Cyber Special Agents - in providing the most advanced security solutions to companies within the blockchain industry.

Andre McGregor, Global Head of Security at TLDR, believes Jon can leverage his considerable experience to further strengthen TLDR's security offering within an ever-growing and challenging digital space:

> "As investment continues to flood into the emerging blockchain industry, hackers have put a bullseye on blockchain companies who haven't paid adequate attention to security. We are excited to have Jon join us in our mission to meet this industry-wide challenge. Jon's more than 15 years of experience will be an invaluable resource for our clients."

Jon will directly support TLDR's security advisory services in conducting physical and digital threat assessments, auditing client organizations for operational security, and architecting and designing security strategies, among other efforts. He will prove integral to TLDR's security offering. As the blockchain space continues to mature there will be a growth in the number of bad actors looking to perpetrate increasingly sophisticated attacks and capitalize on weaknesses characteristic of an industry still finding its feet.

Tom Graham, TLDR's Managing Partner, recognizes the role Jon will play in helping TLDR support companies within the blockchain industry with their growing need for security solutions:

> "The security landscape is ever-growing and we need more and more expert talent like Jon to help blockchain companies avoid becoming the next victim. Jon brings over a decade of experience both in investigations and digital security, which is needed at a time when crypto hacks are becoming more and more prevalent."
