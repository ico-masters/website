Crypto is a new landscape full of emerging projects and excited participants keen to carve out their corner of the blockchain space. There’s a reason for that — crypto is often seen as limitless, borderless, and full of potential when used properly. As discussions about regulation within the major markets continue, some smaller jurisdictions have moved quickly to establish legislative frameworks for crypto. Blockchain companies now have the opportunity to operate legitimately within the controlled environment provided by these jurisdictions, edging crypto slowly closer towards the mainstream.

Within the blockchain bubble, it can be very easy to get carried away with all the positivity surrounding technological developments. But as a fresh project aiming to raise capital and grow a community, the cramped market can seem a little intimidating. Where do you begin?

You may have the mostinnovative, game-changing project ever to hit the crypto sector, but if no-one knows it exists, it has no value.

We’ve spoken previously about some of[the key marketing strategies that projects in this space can adopt](https://medium.com/@TLDR_Global/what-are-some-key-marketing-strategies-for-icos-cabcd64b6ade). In this article our focus is on the four Ws —why,where,what,andwho— to help examine the value of effectively marketing a project.

## WhyPromote Your Project?

The internet is an infinitely large, global audience. But they’re an audience who are unlikely to seek out your project. How can they search for something they don’t know exists?

Without the right promotion, your project is just a concept rather than a viable business. Promotion allows you to really sell your idea, pitch your project to the world, and explain its value. What gap does your project fill? Why do people need what you’re offering?

Failure to properly promote and market a blockchain business can mean that even the most promising projects sink into oblivion. One of TLDR’s Founding Partners, Graham Friedman, explains why it’s vital to gain public awareness:

“Promotion is essential to any public sale. Awareness of product and belief in returns are vital. Ultimately, average investors will follow the herd, and if they believe that they are in company, or better yet,goodcompany, they will be more inclined to participate.”

Gone are the days when the investment was purely about capital. Modern investment is about community, connections, collaboration, and capital. It’s about building a community that wants your project to succeed. TLDR Partner, Eugene Kan, shares his vision on promotion:

“In any emerging space, there’s a lot of education that must be done. Marketing becomes critical to ensure that people are familiar with what’s at hand. It’s about connecting end users with something valuable and relevant in their lives.”

It’s no longer enough to create a project and sit back waiting for customers. You need to find an efficient and engaging way to deliver your brand mission.

## WhereShould Promotional Efforts Be Concentrated?

The first step in any marketing strategy should always be to identify your target audience. TLDR’s Security Program Manager, Kaylie Huntley, explains:

“Promotional efforts won’t go very far if your focus is placed on the wrong audience. If assumptions are made about who the ideal user is, without any critical thought about their validity, many can end up targeting individuals that will never become users at all.”

So, it’s really about understandingyourproject. What does it do? What value does it add? Who will it benefit? By knowing this, you can really pinpoint who you want to direct your marketing efforts towards. Eugene expands on this:

“When searching for a core audience, the obvious question is, who is the person who will benefit the most? Different phases of the marketing cycle require different types of execution.”

Once you’ve found your key user base, you should take the time to invest in a relationship with them before moving onto expansion. Graham shares his views on the value of community:

“Promotion needs to begin with what you have, not what you want. Your core user base needs to become your primary evangelists. Trying to pursue community before investment can be tough. As a result, you must get people to back your strength. They must believe that your product provides the best functionality. Only after you get them motivated can you move on to external parties.”

At this point, once you’ve allowed your core community to thrive, you can begin looking outwards and expanding your reach. Graham explains further:

“The next step is bringing new users into this existing user base. Here you can leverage existing elements, gamification, and awareness campaigns to pull people towards your crew. Finally, when your message and your support are clear, you can launch a broader campaign to convince investors that your project will be a success.”

It’s all about using the tools and resources that you have to reach your audience and allowing that to grow organically — through word-of-mouth, via your community, and with focused marketing efforts.

## WhoShould Promotion Target?

It may be tempting to follow a rigid structure of who you think your project will appeal to, but Kaylie believes this shouldn’t be the case. You should expand your vision beyond the strict subset of people in your direct sphere of interest, and consider a wider audience who could receive benefit from your project:

“Strive to think outside of the box. In identifying your audience, try posing the question more broadly as: ‘whocan this provide value to?’ That may help in identifying new avenues to consider.”

While knowing your core audience is the key to successful marketing, you should also keep an open mind when identifying them. If your product or project can offer value to someone, you should consider them your audience.

## WhatDoes Effective Promotion Look Like?

Consumers are savvier than ever when it comes to marketing, and adblocking software is becoming as ubiquitous as digital security programs. So how do you deliver your message? Graham believes the key is visibility:

“Your campaign should come from all angles and directions. The more they see your logo, the more they will believe in you. This means targeted advertising, organic and paid content on trusted sites, influencer support, and review site rankings. Ideally, anywhere that they search on Google, you should be visible.”

Kaylie agrees with Graham and adds another perspective to consider:

“Truly effective promotion will reach the right person, at the right time, with a clear message of the value of what you have to offer. You don’t need, and shouldn’t want, to market to every individual under the sun. Success will come from targeting your ideal user when they’ll find most value in your product or service.”

Consumers are turned off by the hard sell. They don’t necessarily want polished sales pitches and in-your-face pop-up advertisements. They want transparent, professional, and useful content that adds value to their life. Eugene explains why delivering quality content is so vital:

“Effective promotion is about helping to equip users with the tools to spread your message. It’s not so much virality, as ensuring the message of what you offer, and how you improve on what’s out there, is abundantly clear. This clarity ensures that whether it’s a user’s own social channels or word-of-mouth, they can help spread your message.”

By delivering that high-quality content, you’re effectively opening up a wider and more engaged audience via social media than an ad campaign alone could deliver. Nurture your community and they will become your evangelists.
