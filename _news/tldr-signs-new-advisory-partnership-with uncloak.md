At TLDR, our core ethos focuses on projects that we believe will revolutionize the way we think, work and behave. These are the kind of projects we seek to get involved with and help support and grow. Uncloak, the world's first blockchain-powered digital threat solution, is one of these projects.

## Introducing Uncloak

Uncloak is a project that could completely revolutionize how businesses deal with digital threats. It utilizes the power of the blockchain and powerful, advanced artificial intelligence to check public and hidden data for digital threats. Using true blockchain 3.0, Uncloak allows a global network of verified IT security experts to collaborate in resolving threats and vulnerabilities and be rewarded through a fully automated system.

Having identified a gap in the market, Uncloak has evolved to allow smaller businesses and startups a strong, decentralized digital security system that doesn’t need a large financial outlay or expensive upkeep costs. Founder, CEO and Digital Security Expert, Tayo Dada explains:

> _‘From consulting with some of the largest organizations, we quickly realized that the smaller businesses suffered from the lack of digital security solutions available to them that didn’t require a large capital outlay or expensive security engineers. This discovery led us to create Uncloak, a completely decentralized digital security solution for the masses, that protects businesses regardless of their size.’_

Tayo Dada is the perfect person to deliver this innovative and powerful system. With over 30 years of experience working in IT and a background in managing an award-winning InfoSec team of experts in IT security and Cyber Threat management, we know this project is in safe hands.  

## Aligning Our Visions for Digital Security

Security is an integral part of TLDR’s goals and identity. We make it our mission to provide the highest level of security and protection — from our recently launched [specialized security division](https://medium.com/@TLDR_Capital/tldr-capital-launches-security-division-70b01fbff1f8) to our wealth of [security-focused blog posts](https://medium.com/@TLDR_Capital). This dedication to staying on the cutting edge of digital security innovation is what makes TLDR the perfect advisory partner to Uncloak. Tayo describes why he views TLDR as the perfect fit:

> _‘TLDR was chosen as an advisory primarily on the strength of the core team who have a wealth of digital security experience — greater than any other advisory that we have encountered — coupled with an amazing set of creative marketing consultants on their books, with access to an enviable database of strategic partners and investors.’_

TLDR’s Managing Partner, Tom Graham expands on this:

> _‘TLDR sees Uncloak as a rare example of a decentralized service network that could see adoption today, and that’s exciting. Our joint interests in digital security make this a natural fit. Uncloak is comprised of a highly technical team who have done a great job filling in the gap of protecting small and medium-sized businesses that typically cannot afford best-in-class security products.’_

## The Look Ahead

Uncloak’s aim is to build an extensive channel partnership model that allows their digital security solution to be provided to the global SME market. The immediate focus is to roll out the first build of the Uncloak solution in Q1 2019. The team are very confident that with their knowledge and expertise, alongside the foresight brought by TLDR, Uncloak will be best placed to achieve a number of their strategic goals as per their roadmap. Tayo explains how the partnership with TLDR can help Uncloak move forward with their mission:

> _‘Partnerships are core to the success of Uncloak, or any organization for that matter, and it’s extremely important to be able to mitigate risk by leaning on an experienced team that has unparalleled access to a number of key clients and partners, that we are indeed targeting globally. TLDR as an advisory is best placed to aid us Pre-ICO and Post-ICO, and we believe that they will play a part in our road to gaining a competitive edge in the digital security marketplace.’_

Uncloak is ushering in a new era of digital threat detection and security and TLDR are excited to be involved in such a powerful and innovative reply to digital threats.
