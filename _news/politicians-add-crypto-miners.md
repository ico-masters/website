title: Politicians Add Crypto Miners To Their List of “Enemies”
excerpt: With cryptocurrency mining consuming an ever-increasing amount of energy worldwide, some politicians are starting a push for higher electricity rates for miners, arguing that their activities offer “no utility for society.”

Crypto mining facilities in many countries in Europe and North America enjoy the same discounted electricity rates as other data centers and traditional energy-intensive industries pay.

However, some politicians are trying to include this topic in their agenda. The most recent example comes from Norway.

In a segment aired by Norwegian public broadcaster NRK on Thursday, a local crypto mining firm known as KryptoVault AS were attacked by Lars Haltbrekken, a left-wing member of parliament in Norway, referring to mining as “an enormous waste of resources that perhaps could have been used for something reasonable instead.”

KryptoVault’s representative, former member of parliament Gjermund Hagesæter, defended their activity by pointing out that the alternative for them and other miners in the country would be to move the mining operations to other countries with more polluting energy sources such as coal.
